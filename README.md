This repository is the official implementation of the [T-Mamba: Frequency-Enhanced Gated Long-Range Dependency for Tooth 3D CBCT Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01065.pdf).

More experiments are running ðŸ”¥

Currently, our T-Mamba supports 2D & 3D vision tasks. Welcome to try it for improving your model's performance.

Coming soon...

If u have any quesitons, pls feel free to drop me via isjinghao@gmail.com.
